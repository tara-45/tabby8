msgid "Added a preformed panel system which provides a powerful take on a 'shadow draw' workflow"
msgstr "crwdns46017:0crwdne46017:0"

#: ../../../CHANGELOG.rst:42
msgid "Shadow draw systems allow an adjudication core to form panels prior to a round being drawn. For example, the panels for Round 4 could be formed while Round 3 is taking place. Most implementations do so by having the tab system create a copy of the Round 3 draw, form new panels on top of it, and then transpose these panels onto Round 4. In large tournaments this workflow allows an adjudication core much more time to consider panel formation"
msgstr "crwdns46019:0crwdne46019:0"

#: ../../../CHANGELOG.rst:43
msgid "Tabbycat's preformed panels are formed per-round under a section available under the Setup menu. This interface looks like the standard Edit Adjudicators interface, but the 'debates' shown are based on a simulation of that round's results. These fake debates can then be prioritised"

msgstr "crwdns46023:0crwdne46023:0"

#: ../../../CHANGELOG.rst:45
msgid "By using the existing per-debate priority system, and by giving pre-formed panels their own priority, this workflow allows for very fine amounts of control over exactly how preformed panels are allocated as compared to a more simple top-down transposition of panels. Adjudication cores can easily target general areas of the draw (e.g. break-threshold brackets); control adjudicator strength within and across panels; and still account for special cases where a debate requires a particularly strong panel. At the same time, our existing options for automatic prioritisation and automatic allocation apply to all steps of this process so that preformed panels can be created and deployed rapidly"

msgid "These pages now live-update changes that were made on other instances of that page. As a result, users on different computers can each open the Edit Adjudicators page and see the changes made by the other users. This feature, along with sharding, should make it easier than ever to distribute the task of adjudicator allocation across an entire adjudication core"

msgid "The ballot entry page will now indicate which teams have currently or recently given 'iron person' speeches so that these can be easily tracked, audited, and confirmed.

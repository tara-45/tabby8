#: ../../install/local.rst:10
msgid "Tabbycat is a web-based system: it's designed to run as a web site. However, instead of installing it on a web server, you can install it on your computer, serving web pages to yourself. This is called a local installation."
msgstr "crwdns50259:0crwdne50259:0"

#: ../../install/local.rst:12
msgid "Then, when you open your browser, you can use Tabbycat like any other web site. The only difference is that this one is on **your** computer, not some computer in a data centre in a far-away land. In effect, you are getting your computer to behave like a web server."

msgid "In some cases, you might have a good reason to use a local installation. We can think of just one such reason: If you won't have access to the internet at your tournament, or if internet access will be flaky, then you should use a local installation."

#: ../../install/local.rst:64
msgid "Since a local installation is just having your computer run a web server, it can serve other computers too. You can make this work even if you don't have internet access: all you need is a router that you can use to connect a few computers together. Then other computers on your local network can access the Tabbycat site hosted on your computer. We did this at Victoria Australs 2012."

#: ../../install/local.rst:70
msgid "Be aware that local installs use the Django development server, whose **security is not tested**. Therefore, it's a good idea to make sure your firewall **only lets in computers on your local network** (or, if you're really paranoid, isolate the network from the internet completely)."

msgstr "crwdns50315:0crwdne50315:0"

#: ../../install/local.rst:75
msgid "Probably not. Even if you disable your firewall, chances are your home router (or university router) will block any connections from the outside world to you. Even if you can though, **you really shouldn't**. The local installation uses the *Django development server*, which is a lightweight server designed for developers. Specifically, Django **does not test the security of its development server** in the way that proper web servers do. That is: It's a security risk to run a local installation as an internet-accessible site. Don't do it. `Install Tabbycat on Heroku <install-heroku>`_ instead."

msgid "Alternatively, if you have a background in web development, you might choose to install Tabbycat on your own production server. It's a Django project, so any means of supporting Django projects should work fine."

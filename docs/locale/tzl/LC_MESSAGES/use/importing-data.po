msgid "Sometimes, the simple importer just isn't enough---whether because you need more customization than the simple importer handles (*e.g.* adjudicator feedback questions), or because some participants changed their details after you imported the inital data. In this case, the easiest thing to do is to edit the database via the Django administrative interface (under Setup > Edit Database)."

msgid "We've written a management command called ``importtournament`` to help automate the tournament set-up. The script, however, is neither foolproof nor comprehensive, so you might find you need to modify things slightly if your tournament structure is different from ours. Be prepared to try this a few times to get it to work. Nonetheless, this is probably the fastest way to set up a tournament."

msgid "If our suggested file formats cause you headaches, it might be easier to write your own importer. We have a generic importer framework that should make this easier, so for some tournaments it might (very conceivably) be faster to write your own importer to conform to your data, than it is to make your data conform to our importer. You need a background in Python in order to do this. For more details, see :ref:`tournament-data-importers`."

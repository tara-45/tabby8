msgid "Tabbycat supports a basic form of venue constraints. A **venue constraint** is a requirement that a particular **team, adjudicator, institution** or **division** be assigned to a venue in a particular **venue category**.  Typical uses would include:"

msgid "Constraints apply to **venue categories**, not individual venues. That is, you specify that (say) a team should be given a venue from a particular *list* of venues. Of course, it's permissible for a venue category to have only one venue in it."

msgid "The algorithm used to satisfy venue constraints is not guaranteed to be optimal. In some rare cases, it may propose an allocation that fails some constraints, even though some other allocation would have satisfied all (or more) constraints. In almost all practical circumstances, however, it should work, and save human effort (and time) in specially allocating rooms."

msgid "Currently, Tabbycat doesn't tell you which of these happened, so if the venue allocation fails to meet all your constraints, it's on you to figure out why. In most scenarios, we imagine you'll have few enough constraints that this will be obvious; for example, if the chief adjudicator is judging a team with accessibility requirements, it might be obvious that the latter's constraint took priority. We might in future add support for more useful guidance on conflicting constraints, but we currently consider this to be of low priority."

      The team standings precedence is empty. This means that teams aren't

      Tabbycat assigns sides in elimination rounds randomly. However, because in elimination rounds, many tournaments draw lots for sides in front of an audience, the sides are marked as "unconfirmed", so that it doesn't look like sides have been pre-assigned. After you confirm the draw, you'll need to confirm sides on the "Edit Sides/Matchups" page, even if you wish to accept Tabbycat's random assignment.

msgid "Tabbycat doesn't provide an in-built backup system; instead you should create copies of your database directly. Heroku provides a very good backup utility for all sites hosted on Heroku which makes this easy, and for Heroku-based Tabbycat sites, we strongly recommend it."

msgid "You should **always** back up the database before deleting *any* data while in the Edit Database area, because deleting data cannot be undone. It is also a good idea to back up the database before doing anything in the Edit Database area, unless you're very familiar and confident with editing the Tabbycat database directly."

msgid "If you're using an online version of Tabbycat, it's a good idea to download the backups. While it's extremely rare to lose internet access or have an outage in a critical web service (*i.e.*, Heroku), having a local copy of your backups allows you to :ref:`restore your tab to a local installation <backup-restore-to-local>` if this ever happens."

msgid "Unlike the rest of our documentation, this section does not deal with particular features or technical concerns with Tabbycat itself. Instead it is an attempt to outline the logistics of tab direction and aims to be of general relevance for people running major tournaments. At present, it is organised by the various ‘stages' of tabbing a tournament, and most of the content takes the form of check-lists or comments designed to highlight and provide guidance on common issues."

msgid "Whilst it aims for general relevance, we should note that this guide is relatively opinionated and mostly written from the perspective of people whose primary experience is tabbing at Australasian tournaments using Tabbycat. That said, we welcome feedback and additions that can account for different format and regional considerations. In the future, if the guide becomes more general and more extensive, it could be spun off into a separate project."

msgid "You should avoid being the sole person responsible for that tab unless it is a small tournament. There are many cases where you want to be in several places at once and the easiest way to accommodate that is by having co-directors or trusted assistants. Few tab decisions require a single source of authority; it is far better to have multiple people available to share responsibilities around."

msgid "In a similar manner, it is worth considering how you can use the tournament to help train other people. Typically, knowledge of tabbing is concentrated in relatively few people and gained mostly through on-the-ground experience; meaning that every tournament should be approached as rare opportunity to help spread knowledge about tabbing more widely in a circuit. Consider reaching out to institutions or the tournament as a whole to see if they have anyone who would be interested in helping out."

msgid "Whether internet access will be available and whether participants can be presumed to have smart phones. This has an obvious impact on how online feedback, ballots, and draw release is done. Note that Eduroam is not necessarily a reliable guarantee of access; many participants will come from universities who don't have access to it or will need to follow a setup process that is onerous or requires them to be at their home institution."

Depending on the license of your tabbing software and the nature of your tournament (for profit vs not for profit) this may be required.

msgid "Will Swing teams be available? You should plan to have at least one more than you need. For example, with 39 teams, you should have both an 40th swing team to fill in the draw, and the option to easily assemble an 41st swing team in case a team goes missing. At very large tournaments (say over 150 teams) you should plan for even more swing team capacity — it's not unheard of for say three teams to vanish all in a single round. In these cases, you should try and ensure that the swing teams are always ready to go — i.e. that that they are pre-formed, you have a clear communication channel with them, and that they distributed/waiting near the debating rooms so they can fill in at a moment's notice (often you will only find out that teams are missing right as debates are scheduled to start)."

msgid "How will critical information be communicated to participants? Consider that in general, Facebook announcements do not reach many people, although paying to boost the posts is often a very cheap way of dramatically raising their effectiveness. In particular also ensure or check how you manage to get in touch with teams or adjudicators who go missing: will they have reliable phone numbers? Can you get a list of institutional reps who can be reliably called? You want to have processes in place for chasing up adjudicators who do things such as make scoring mistakes as soon as possible in order to minimise delays."

msgid "How will critical information be shared between the tab team, adjudication core, and logistics/convening teams? For smaller/medium sized tournaments a group chat augmented by phone calls (assuming everyone knows everyone else's number) can be sufficient, but even then, you need to ensure that any critical information conveyed privately (i.e. in a call or in person) is conveyed back to the group channel. At very large tournaments (or if you have the resources) walkie-talkies are an excellent way to manage communication — just make sure you have (ahead of time) reserve the different channels to a distinct and known purpose (i.e. general discussion; just the tab team & adjudication core; just convenors)."

msgstr "crwdns49185:0crwdne49185:0"

msgid "Registration data should be collected into a shared and live-updating source, such as a Google Sheet. There should be as few canonical sources (ideally one) of data as possible; i.e. there should be a single sheet for individual details, a single sheet for team details, etc; and these should be maintained all the way through to check-in. For both you, and the registration team, having multiple conflicting or outdated copies of data will lead to errors. However, for the registration team these errors can usually be easily sorted out in person (at check-in) but for you that information always needs to be reliable and up to date otherwise what is imported into the tab cannot be trusted."
msgstr "crwdns49187:0crwdne49187:0"

msgid "Paper-based feedback is much more taxing to enter than paper-based scoresheets —  typically there is much more of it; it asks for a greater variety of data; and it is submitted at inconsistent times. The one advantage is that it is easier to make feedback mandatory with paper, as you can ensure all teams and adjudicators have done so prior to leaving the room. Thus, in most cases, a good online feedback system is much more preferable than paper. If using paper be aware that you will need a lot of volunteers to ensure the feedback is collected promptly. If internet or smartphone access is limited at your tournament it is probably best to accommodate both paper-based and online methods."
msgstr "crwdns49247:0crwdne49247:0"

#: ../../guide/tournament-logistics.rst:105
msgid "The consequences of having incorrect or missing ballots are much more severe than for feedback. As such major tournaments use paper ballots in some form as the final stage in a checking process to ensure that the results of a debate are definitely correct — adjudicators will always make mistakes and while digital ballots can catch/prevent some types of error (i.e. a low point win) they can't catch others (assigning the wrong scores to the wrong speaker, nominating the wrong winning team, etc.). Assuming your software supports both options, the choice is thus whether to use a hybrid approach (online submission followed by paper verification) or to rely entirely on paper. A fully-paper based approach will be simpler for both yourself and adjudicators, and can be almost as efficient if you have a sufficient number of volunteers. In contrast, a hybrid approach will be potentially much faster if you are short of volunteers and if you expect that almost all adjudicators will have access to the internet, a smartphone, and are capable of following instructions."

From what we understand this performs a dual role, as both a backup system that can take over from the main one (say if internet access drops) and as a way of verifying ballot data (by comparing draws or databases between software rather than having a two-step entry process operating for a single tab). This practice seems obsolete when working with modern web-based tab software that is capable of backing up and restoring to an offline system, but we would like to hear your feedback if you think that is not the case."

The adjudication core can then override the conflict, discuss it with the teams, or raise it with equity. However, if going down this route, the tab team should discuss with the adjudication core how to manage this process well-ahead of the tournament, and ensure they actually do review the conflicts prior to the first round — otherwise it will likely surface during an allocation and become a major distraction during a critical time period."

Does the software optimise panel strength for a voting majority, or across all panellists? When does the software allocate solo chairs over panels? How does it avoid conflicts?

    Stopgap to warn user about potential database inconsistency, when trainee adjudicators
    seem to have given scores. This normally happens when an adjudicator was demoted after
    a result was entered. See: https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat/issues/922
    This stopgap should be deleted after a more general data consistency solution is
    implemented.

      This can happen if you demote a panellist to trainee after a result has been
      submitted for that debate. This may indicate that there is an inconsistency
      in results data, which may cause unexpected results (or crashes). Please
      consider going to the Edit Database area and deleting the offending
      <a href="{{ editdb_speakerscorebyadj_url }}?debate_adjudicator__type__exact=T" class="alert-link">"speaker
      scores by adj" objects</a>, and then opening and resaving the result here.

    Another warning about potential database inconsistency, but this one's only
    ever happened as a consequence of direct database edits via SQL, so we've
    probably already got all the consistency checks we can reasonably have. This
    is just an extra courtesy for users who try to hack too much.

  {% if debates_with_multiple_confirmed_ballots_found %}
    {% blocktrans trimmed asvar message %}
      One or more debates in this round appear to have more than one confirmed
      ballot submission. This can cause unexpected results (or crashes), because
      Tabbycat assumes that each debate has at most one confirmed ballot
      submission. This inconsistency can generally only arise if you manipulate
      the database with SQL queries directly. You'll need to find the offending
      debate(s) and ballot submissions yourself in the Edit Database area, or if
      that doesn't work, you might need to find them using SQL queries directly.

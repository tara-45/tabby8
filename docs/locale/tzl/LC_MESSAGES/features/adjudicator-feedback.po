#: ../../features/adjudicator-feedback.rst:130
msgid "where :math:`w` is the feedback weight for the round. Note that because the feedback score is averaged across all pieces of feedback (rather than on a per-round total) rounds in which a person receives feedback from many sources (say from all teams and all panellists) could impact their average score much more than a round in which they only receive feedback from one or two sources."
msgstr "crwdns47419:0:math:crwdne47419:0"

#: ../../features/adjudicator-feedback.rst:132
msgid "Under this formula, each round's feedback weight can be used to determine the relative influence of the base score vs feedback in determining the overall score. As an example, say that an adjudicator received 5.0 as their base score, but their average feedback rating has thus far been 2.0. If the current rounds' feedback weight is set to 0.75, then their overall score would be 2.75. If the current round's feedback weight is set to 0.5 their score would be 3.5. If the weight was 0, their score will always be their base score; if the weight was 1 it will always be their average feedback value."
msgstr "crwdns47421:0crwdne47421:0"

#: ../../features/adjudicator-feedback.rst:141
msgid "To change the weight of a round you will need to go to the Edit Database area, open the round in question, and change its *Feedback weight* value. It is common to set rounds with a low feedback weight value early on in the tournament (when feedback is scant) and to increase the feedback weight as the tournament progresses."
msgstr "crwdns47423:0crwdne47423:0"

#: ../../features/adjudicator-feedback.rst:143
msgid "A participant's base score can, in conjunction with feedback weight, also be used as a manual override for an adjudicator's overall ranking. At several tournaments, adjudication cores have set every round's feedback weight to 0, and manually adjusted an adjudicator's base score in response to feedback they have received and reviewed. In this way complete control over every adjudicator's overall score can be exerted."

#: ../../features/adjudicator-feedback.rst:150
msgid "There are some cases where feedback should be discarded or ignored, but there are some differences between the two. Discarded feedback is mostly due to having another piece of feedback that supersedes the discarded ones. Ignored feedback is different as it still counts the affected feedback as submitted, just inconsequential, ignored in the adjudicator's score calculation."
msgstr "crwdns47431:0crwdne47431:0"

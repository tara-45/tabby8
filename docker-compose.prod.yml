# Docker-compose is a way to run multiple containers at once and connect them
# This sets up and runs postgres, redis, honcho and the django worker as services
# Reference: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
# Note that this file extends and overrides what is specified in docker-compose.yml

# Initial setup with
# $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Can run management commands with
# $ docker-compose run web /code/manage.py whatever

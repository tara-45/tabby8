    """Base class for break generators.

    A break generator is responsible for populating the database with the
    list of breaking teams.

    The main method is `generate()`, which runs five steps:

    1. `set_team_queryset()`, which sets `self.team_queryset` to a QuerySet that
       queries all teams relevant to this break category. In the default
       implementation, this is all teams in the tournament if the break category
       is a general break category, and all teams eligible for the break
       category if it is not a general break category.

    2. `retrieve_standings()`, which sets `self.standings` to a Standings
       object. This function uses the metrics set in the tournament preferences,
       and the rankings specified in the `rankings` class attribute.

    3. `filter_eligible_teams()`, which sets `self.excluded_teams` to a dict
       mapping StandingInfo objects to BreakingTeam.REMARK_* constants, and sets
       `self.eligible_teams` to a list of StandingInfo objects for eligible
       teams, in the same order as they were found in `self.standings`.

    4. `compute_break()`, which sets `self.breaking_teams` to a list of
       StandingInfo objects, corresponding to the breaking teams (in order).
       Subclasses must implement this method.

    5. `populate_database()`, which writes the computed break and excluded teams
       to the database.

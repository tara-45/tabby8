class BPHungarianDrawGenerator(BaseBPDrawGenerator):
    """Power-paired draw for BP based on the Hungarian algorithm.
    With default options, this is WUDC-compliant.

    Options:
        "pullup" - How pull-ups are distributed. Permitted values:

            "anywhere" - Pull-up teams may be paired into any room in the entire
                         bracket.

            "one_room" - All pull-up teams must be paired into the same room.
                         This room is then the lowest room in the bracket, sort
                         of functioning as an intermediate bracket, except that
                         any team from the brackets above and below may be
                         paired into it. Not WUDC-compliant.

        "position_cost" - How position costs are assigned. Permitted values:

            "simple"   - Cost is the number of times the team has already been
                         in that position, less the number of times the team has
                         been in its least frequent position.

            "entropy"  - Rényi entropy, C = n[2 - H_α(p)], where p is the
                         empirical distribution associated with the position
                         history of the team, H_α(p) is the Rényi entropy of
                         order α thereof, and n is the number of rounds the team
                         has competed in. See the "renyi_order" option below.

            "variance" - The population variance of multiplicities in the
                         history.

        "exponent" - (float) The value returned by the cost function is raised
                     to this power. Higher exponents place more weight on
                     reducing larger problems, i.e., highly uneven position
                     histories. Most tournaments should use a value between 2.0
                     and 5.0.

        "renyi_order" - (float) The order of the Rényi entropy used, often
                        denoted by α. The case α = 1.0 yields Shannon entropy;
                        α = 0.0 Hartley entropy; α = 2.0 collision entropy.

        "assignment_method" - Algorithm used to solve the assignment problem.
                              Permitted values:

            "hungarian"             - Hungarian algorithm, with no randomness.
                                      Not WUDC-compliant.

            "hungarian_preshuffled" - Hungarian algorithm, with the rows and
                                      columns of the cost matrix permuted
                                      randomly beforehand.

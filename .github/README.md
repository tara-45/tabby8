Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for British Parliamentary and a variety of two-team formats. It was used at Australs 2010 and 2012‚Äì2019, EUDC 2018, WUDC 2019‚Äì2022 and many other tournaments of all sizes and formats. To see an example of a post-tournament website, have a look at the [WUDC 2022 tab website](https://wudc2022.calicotab.com/wudc/).

**Want to try it out?** The best way to trial Tabbycat is just to launch a new site, as described [below](#%EF%B8%8F-installation)). It takes just a few clicks, requires no technical background, and you can always deploy a fresh copy when you're ready to run your tournament.

## üîç Features

- A range of setup options. Tabbycat powers Calico, a paid service for hosting tournaments. Tabbycat can also run as a local installation (natively, or via Docker) and be deployed to the free-tiers of the Render or Heroku platforms.
- Enter data from multiple computers simultaneously and (optionally) display results, draws, and other information online
- Collect ballots and feedback online, or from printed forms customised for each round ( adjudicator feedback questions and rankings [are configurable](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/adjudicator-feedback.html))
- Automated adjudicator allocations based on adjudicator ranking, debate priority, and conflicts/clashes
- A drag and drop interface for adjudicator allocation that displays conflicts alongside break liveness and gender/regional/language balance considerations
- A responsive interface that adapts to suit large screens, laptops, tablets, and phones
- Support for British Parliamentary (EUDC/WUDC), Australs, NZ Easters, Australian Easters, Joynt Scroll, UADC, and WSDC rule sets as well as configurable [draw generation rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/draw-generation.html) and [team standings rules](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/standings-rules.html)

## üìñ Documentation

Our user guide is at [tabbycat.readthedocs.io](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/).

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Installation

Tabbycat can be used in a number of ways.

[Calico](https://calicotab.com/) is a managed hosting service run by one of Tabbycat's developers. For a flat fee, it will host tab websites, automatically manage their setup and performance, and provide ongoing access to the released tab. Click this button to deploy to Calico:

[![Deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gist/tienne-B/fc04ecd3c11a38424b642b4bba60e8d9/raw/b2c71d7d6a0d368d3e9dfd8002af729d155ad09b/calicodeploy.svg)](https://calicotab.com/tournaments/new/)

If you do not want to use Calico, you will need to setup and manage your own copy of Tabbycat:

1. For tournaments that require online access, you can [install and run Tabbycat from Heroku](https://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/heroku.html). However, this will cost a small amount of money _unless_ you are a student and have registered for free Heroku hosting credits
2. For tournaments where online access is unnecessary, you can [install and run Tabbycat from your own computer](https://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/local.html)

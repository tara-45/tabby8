# Artillery installed as part of npm development requirements
# Usage (note lack of trailing / on the URL):
#   (setup 88-team BP tournament; enable public info; release R1 draw & motions)
#   (restart dynos on heroku)
#   $ npx artillery run bin/artillery-draw.yml --target APP
# Testing Environment:
#   DEBUG=0
#   PUBLIC_FAST_CACHE_TIMEOUT=30
#   PUBLIC_SLOW_CACHE_TIMEOUT=30
#   TAB_PAGES_CACHE_TIMEOUT=30
#   Hobby dynos
# Note that a single heroku dyno has a hard limit of 50 requests in its backlog;
# testing limits should not exceed that (say 40 to account for latency?) else
# pages will refuse to be served

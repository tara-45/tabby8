"""Simulates a competition with a given number of teams and institutions, up to
a given number of rounds. Prints out the teams (identified by numbers),
institutions (letters), number of wins, history (team numbers) and aff counts.

This script does not interact with the database at all. It is used for
generating test cases for the tests in test_draw.py. It also does not have any
unit tests itself: it is used to generate test cases to insert into
test_draw.py.

This script must be run from the directory it is in."""
